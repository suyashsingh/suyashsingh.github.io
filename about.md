Hello, I am Suyash, an embedded software engineer who works at [Center of Development Of Advanced Computing (C-DAC Pune)](https://cdac.in/).
 
I currently live at pune, a lively city in the western indian state of Maharashtra. Trust me Pune's tea and wada paw is definitely
going to sweep you off your feet!

Previously I was employed at [Fenopix](https://fenopix.com/), where I worked as a software test engineer and was involved with the product [CanvasJS](https://canvasjs.com). It gave me an opportunity to connect with the web community, learn from them and help them out in developing web applications with CanvasJS.

Here are the [forum queries I handled at CanvasJS](https://canvasjs.com/forums/users/suyash-singh/replies/) & [a Release Post](https://canvasjs.com/blog/author/suyash-singh/).

Iâ€™ve a [Post Graduate Diploma in Embedded Systems Design (PG-DESD)](https://www.cdac.in/index.aspx?id=DESD&courseid=22) from C-DAC, Pune. Here is more about PG-DESD from the [Indian National Qualifications Register page](https://www.nqr.gov.in/qualification-title?nid=2995). I completed my graduation in Electronics and Communication from Lovely Professional University, Jalandhar Punjab.

## Interest Areas
I have a passion for Embedded Electronics and I love to fiddle & tinker with microcontrollers.
Describing your likings is always difficult, here is a fair try:
+ Microcontrollers
+ Linux
+ Linux Device Drivers
+ Real Time Operating Systems / RTOS Porting
+ Bootloaders
+ Porting Linux
+ Embedded Linux: Yocto Project, Buildroot, BusyBox, Openembedded

I also like like having fun with IoT, Raspberry Pi **but as a Hobby**. I am much more interested in getting under the hood where I can get my
hands dirty.

## Hobbies
I like to Cook, play guitar, and click pictures.

## About this Website
This website is all about my journey into embedded systems. Technically it can be thought of as logs about what I have learned over the time.

I developed a liking towards web in my previous job at CanvasJS, the affair still continues and so is this website.

`suyashsingh.github.io` is hosted on `github pages`. I use `jekyll` for generating this website. I write most of the pages in `markdown` except for
a few pages which require more customizations. Jekyll builds up the entire website based on templates, handles links, navigation, etc. I use `Bootstrap 4`
as HTML / CSS / JS framework. 

Github pages simplifies the deployment of the website. All I need to do is to push new code in to the master branch and changes goes live.

If you would like to take a look [say no more(source code)!](https://github.com/suyashsingh/suyashsingh.github.io)

If there is anything else you would want to know about me please feel free to [contact me](/contact.html).
