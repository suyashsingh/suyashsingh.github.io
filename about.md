## About this Website
This website is all about my journey into embedded systems. Technically it can be thought of as logs about what I have learned over the time.

I developed a liking towards web during my previous employment at CanvasJS, the affair still continues and so is this website. This website i.e. `suyashsingh.github.io` is hosted on `github pages`. I use `jekyll` for generating this website. I write most of the pages in `markdown` except for a few pages which require more customizations. Jekyll builds up the entire website based on templates, handles links, navigation, etc. I use `Bootstrap 4`
as HTML / CSS / JS framework. Github pages simplifies the deployment of the website. All I need to do is to push new code in to the master branch and changes goes live.

You can have a look at <a href="https://github.com/suyashsingh/suyashsingh.github.io" title="source code of suyashsingh.github.io" target="blank">source code of suyashsingh.github.io here</a>.
